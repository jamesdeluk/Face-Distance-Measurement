# Face-Distance-Measurement
In this project, we are going to find the distance between a face and a normal webcam. We will use some basic mathematics along with some AI techniques to achieve decent accuracy. To solidify the concept we will use it in an example project, where the size of the text increases if the person is far away from the screen.
